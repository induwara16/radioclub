The Radio Club of Royal College, established in the year 1925 is one of the oldest clubs at Royal College. Formed with the main objective of inspiring young royalists in many fields of radio and technology, it was founded as the Radio Listeners Club by the College Prefects during the tenure of Principal Major H.L. Reed and since has one of the most essential clubs in the school by maintaining and operating much of the audiovisual assets at the College, including the sound systems and the school's PA systems. The club provides services to other clubs and societies on a frequent basis as the technological partners for their occasions on matters which concern electronics, audio, or video, and liaise with other schools on these matters as well.

Today the club is responsible for many pioneering initiatives. Since its upcoming, the Radio Club has successfully completed several massive projects such as Crown Cast, Paramount and one of the College's most famous and memorable annual projects, FM Royal. And we as the Radio Club of Royal College hope to make the students capable of working with various technologies and create a platform where they can motivate themselves to research and think new, rather than recreating what is currently practiced in the country.
