Royal College Radio Club was inaugurated in the year of 1925 as the Radio Listeners’ Club by the College Prefects during the tenure of then principal of Royal College – Mr. H.L Reed, making it one of the school’s oldest clubs. Since then, the club has been responsible for pioneering various initiatives.

Members of the club maintain and operate much of the audiovisual assets at the College, including the sound systems and the school’s PA systems. It also provides services to other clubs and societies on a frequent basis on matters which concern electronics, audio or video, and liaise with other schools on these matters as well.

The Radio Club also organizes various events throughout each year aimed to both serve the College as well as to improve the skills and capabilities of its members. These projects include FM Royal, which is the first ever school-managed FM radio station to operate in South Asia.
