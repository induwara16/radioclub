FM Royal, the first-ever radio station by a school in South Asia is a joint venture organized by both the Radio Club of Royal College and the Media Unit of Royal College.

This Year with our 26th Annual transmission, we continue to break new ground with yet another memorable broadcast. This remarkable achievement is a testament to the broadcasting skills and dedication of Royal College students. To date, FM Royal has had 25 successful broadcasts, some of which have gained special prominence. In 1995, for example, FM Royal became the official radio station for the South Asian Games, while in 2000, it provided live coverage of the Bradby Shield Encounter.

FM Royal has also pioneered several successful technologies in Sri Lanka, including the FM Royal 'Web Cast,' which launched in 2005 as Sri Lanka's first 24-hour Internet mirror of an FM broadcast. The FM Royal Podcast, launched in 2006, was also the first service of its kind in the country. In 2014, FM Royal went worldwide with the FM Royal application and was broadcasted in three major cities, including Colombo, Kandy, and Galle.

This year, the Radio Club of Royal College and the Media Unit of Royal College hope to carry on the legacy of FM Royal in a superior fashion like never seen before, transmitting live on **107.3 MHz** and on our official FM Royal webpage [FMROYAL.LIVE](https://fmroyal.live). In addition to the regular broadcasts, this year's FM Royal will feature a “Videocast” series where we'll be filming and uploading segments to the Official FM Royal YouTube channel done with famous Royalist's in Sri Lanka where they can talk about their school life and experiences in school.
